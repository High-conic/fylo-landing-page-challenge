## My process

Started with skeleton/structure of the webpage then moved to the styling using CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned and got a better understanding of how layout of webpages work and how to manipulate them to your taste using CSS.

### Continued development

I would like to develop more in the aspect of responsiveness and layout across several device displays.
